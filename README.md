As discussed over the call, I am sharing you the Assignment Test kindly check and revert asap.


You need to create a project using Open Weather map and create a UI where user must select country and state. Once selected then click on submit to get the current weather data from API and display it on webpage. UI must contain table view, card view and modals.

1. In table you need to show all the weather information coming from API.
2. In card view you must show the image as per weather like sunny, rainy etc.
3. In modal you need to print the beautified JSON data from the API and display it so the user can copy paste it by clicking on the copy icon present on the modal.

The rest is up to him how you wants to represent the UI.
